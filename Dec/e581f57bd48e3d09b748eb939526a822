8 December 2014Minister of Communications, Ms Faith Muthambi will be the key note speaker at the Soul Buddyz Club National Congress awards ceremony. The Minister will be recognizing the clubs outstanding performance, their partnership with SABC1 and its member s dedication in becoming active citizens of the country, as it is called upon us by the National Development Plan. Formed in 2002, the club, which now spans 6,000 children as active members in all nine provinces, evolved from the hugely successful SABC1 television series, Soul Buddyz. The Soul Buddyz Club has proven to be a successful platform where all children between the ages of 8 and 14 years old learn and develop skills which drive mobilization around children s rights and issues which affect not only them, but their surrounding schools and greater communities.Members of the media are invited as follows: Date: Monday, 08 December 2014 Time: 17h00 Venue: Rustenburg Kloof: 1 Donkerhoek Road, Rustenburg, 0300 GPS: S 25.68588 E 27.19365 Enquiries: Ayanda Holo Cell:061 488 0634 Follow the Minister on twitter @faithmuthambiIssued by Department of Communications on behalf of the Ministry of Communications

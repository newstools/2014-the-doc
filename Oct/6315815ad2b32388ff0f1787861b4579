30 October 2014This year s GovTech conference and exhibition hosted by the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) will focus on the state of e-government adoption in South Africa, examining a number of the challenges limiting the reach and impact of e-government. Papers to be delivered by some of the leading minds in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector will, on the basis of real life case studies, reflect on the successes achieved in recent years. They will also critically examine several social, economic and political barriers constraining the scope of transformation and restricting the ability of policy makers to make effective use of new technology, says SITA s CEO Freeman Nomvalo.GovTech 2014 will be hosted at the Durban International Convention Centre between 2 and 5 November. The SITA hosted conference and exhibition under the theme, Government: Empowered by Technology, will be the culmination of a four year themed series. In 2011 the conference focused on connecting government and the ICT sector, while the last two years themes centred around the efficient use of information technology across and beyond government and innovation for a 21st century government respectively.GovTech 2014, SITA s 9th annual conference and exhibition, provides a platform whereby local and international ICT best practices will be showcased, deliberated on, and learned from. The event is designed by government for government and is firmly entrenched as South Africa s premier event for key stakeholders involved in public sector ICT. The event is targeted at DGs, deputy DGs, CIOs, CTO, directors and other senior level leaders across all levels of government as well as top level representation from large, medium and small ICT organisations. It is anticipated that approximately 1 200 representatives from across national, provincial and local government will be in attendance this year, together with delegates from private sector organisations.Media booking form ProgrammeFor more information and to book, visit www.govtech.co.za or call 0800 GOVTECH (0800 4688324).Issued by State Information Technology AgencyEnquiries: Amitha Ramlal: 0124822399/ 0795788624 amitha.ramlal@sita.co.zaOr Bontle Tsikwe: 012 482 2695/ 084 813 1897 bontle.tsikwe@sita.co.za
